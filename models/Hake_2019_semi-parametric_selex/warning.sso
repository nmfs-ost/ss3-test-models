1 NOTE: This model has just one settlement event. Changing to recr_dist_method 4 and removing the recruitment distribution parameters at the end of the MG parms section (below growth parameters) will produce identical results and simplify the model.
2 The experimental 2D_AR selectivity smoother option is selected!
3 Minimum pop size bin:_10; is > L at Amin for sex: 1; Gpat: 1; L= 5
4 Final gradient: 5.56321e-05 is larger than final_conv: 1e-05
N warnings: 4
