Note 1 Suggestion: This model has just one settlement event. Changing to recr_dist_method 4 and removing the recruitment distribution parameters at the end of the MG parms section (below growth parameters) will produce identical results and simplify the model.
Warning 1 : The experimental 2D_AR selectivity smoother option is selected!
Warning 2 : Minimum pop size bin:_10; is > L at Amin for sex: 1; Gpat: 1; L= 5
Warning 3 : 1st iteration warning: catch logL > 50% total logL; check configuration; suggest start with larger R0
Warning 4 : Main recdev biasadj is >2 times ratio of rmse to sigmaR
Warning 5 : Early recdev biasadj is >2 times ratio of rmse to sigmaR
