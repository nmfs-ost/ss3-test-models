1 fishing fleet: 1 surveytime read as: 1 normally is -1 for fishing fleet; can override for indiv. obs. using 1000+month

3 NOTE: This model has just one settlement event. Changing to recr_dist_method 4 and removing the recruitment distribution parameters at the end of the MG parms section (below growth parameters) will produce identical results and simplify the model.
4 bias adjustment ramp extends into forecast; biasadj set to 0.0 internally for forecast years
5 setting in starter does not request all priors, and 26 parameters have priors and are not estimated, so their prior not included in obj_fun.
 N parameters are on or within 1% of min-max bound: 1; check results, variance may be suspect
N warnings: 5
