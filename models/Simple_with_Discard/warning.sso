Note 1 Information: Max data length bin: 90  < max pop len bins: 94; so will accumulate larger pop len bins
Note 2 Suggestion: This model has just one settlement event. Changing to recr_dist_method 4 and removing the recruitment distribution parameters at the end of the MG parms section (below growth parameters) will produce identical results and simplify the model.
Warning 1 : Main recdev biasadj is >2 times ratio of rmse to sigmaR
Warning 2 : Reminder: Number of lamdas !=0.0 and !=1.0:  1
