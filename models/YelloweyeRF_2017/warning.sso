1 NOTE:  Max data length bin: 74  < max pop len bins: 88; so will accumulate larger pop len bins
2 NOTE: recr_dist_method 3 is simpler and takes 1 parm for each settlement
3  max harvest rate typically is >1.0 for F_method 2, 3 or 4 0.9
4 setting in starter does not request all priors, and 4 parameters have priors and are not estimated, so their prior not included in obj_fun.
5 Final gradient: 0.00137303 is larger than final_conv: 0.0001
 N parameters are on or within 1% of min-max bound: 1; check results, variance may be suspect
N warnings: 5
