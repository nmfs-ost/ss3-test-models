1 fishing fleet: 1 surveytime read as: 1 normally is -1 for fishing fleet; can override for indiv. obs. using 1000+month
2 fishing fleet: 2 surveytime read as: 1 normally is -1 for fishing fleet; can override for indiv. obs. using 1000+month

4 NOTE: This model has just one settlement event. Changing to recr_dist_method 4 and removing the recruitment distribution parameters at the end of the MG parms section (below growth parameters) will produce identical results and simplify the model.
5 setting in starter does not request all priors, and 1 parameters have priors and are not estimated, so their prior not included in obj_fun.
6 Final gradient: 0.00046785 is larger than final_conv: 0.0001
7 Reminder: Number of lamdas !=0.0 and !=1.0:  4
 N parameters are on or within 1% of min-max bound: 3; check results, variance may be suspect
N warnings: 7
